The game is live at: https://quiet-shore-40615.herokuapp.com/
To play - after signup, choose player name from the left side-bar and click on it.
U can play vs yourself but no points will be added.
To simulate 2 players game - one must connect from another browser since the authentication is by cookie and by default set per browser and not per tab.
To run the code locally: go to game-lobby.js line 63-64 and toggle the comment. Cmd-line: nodemon ./game/app.js. Pay attention that u need mongo account with database set.

Enjoy :)
